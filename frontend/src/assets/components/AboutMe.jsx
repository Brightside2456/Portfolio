            <p>
                I am a motivated and vivacious student who excels at critical analysis,
                decision-making, and teamwork. I have produced numerous projects that have helped me learn
                along the way thanks to my ability to work well in teams and my programming and IoT skill set.
                I have the capability to work hard and face setbacks head-on, which inspires me to never give up.
